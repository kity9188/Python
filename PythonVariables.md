# Python Variables

## 1. Creating Variables
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it.
e.g.:
~~~
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
~~~
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
~~~
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
~~~
## 2. Rule for Variable Names
* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* ***Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)***
