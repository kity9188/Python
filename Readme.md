# Python Variables

Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when we create a variable, we reserve some space in the memory.

Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, we can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.

Creating variables has some rules which we should keep in mind.
variable name  has to start with either a letter (upper or lower case) or an underscore(_).
variable name can't be started with a number.
We can also use numbers in variable names, just not as the first letter.
We can declare same variable with Upper case and lower case letter as python will consider it distinct not same.

### Assigning Values to Variables
* eg:1
```python
greeting = "Hello" #assigning variable
name = str(input("Please enter your name: ")) #assigning variable at runtime
print(greeting+''+name) # printing variables
```
* eg:2
```python
a = 12
b = 3
c = a + b
d = c /3
e = d -4
print (e * 12)
```

## Standard Data Types
Python has five standard data types âˆ’
1. Numbers
2. String
3. List
4. Tuple
5. Dictionary

    1. ### Python Numbers:
        * var1 = 1
        * var2 = 10
        
        Python supports three different numerical types:
        * int (signed integers)
        * float (floating point real values)
        * complex (complex numbers)
        
       ```All integers in Python3 are represented as long integers. Hence, there is no separate number type as long.```
        
        Examples:
        
        int  | float | Complex
        ------------- | ------------- | -------------
        10  |    0.0     |  3.14j
        -786  | -21.9  |  -.6545+0J
        
        ```A Complex Number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x + yj, where x and y are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.```
             
    2. ### Python Strings
        Python allows either pair of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 to the end.
        
        The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.
        
        Example:
            
        ```python
        str = 'Hello World!'
             
        print (str)          # Prints complete string
        print (str[0])       # Prints first character of the string
        print (str[2:5])     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
        print (str[2:])      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
        print (str * 2)      # Prints string two times
        print (str + "TEST") # Prints concatenated string
        ```
             
        This will produce the below result:
        ```text
        Hello World!
        H
        llo
        llo World!
        Hello World!Hello World!
        Hello World!TEST
        ```
    3. ### Python Lists
        * A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]).
        * To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One of the differences between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.
        
        The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.
        
        ```python
        list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
        tinylist = [123, 'john']
        
        print (list)          # Prints complete list
        print (list[0])       # Prints first element of the list
        print (list[1:3])     # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
        print (list[2:])      # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
        print (tinylist * 2)  # Prints list two times
        print (list + tinylist) # Prints concatenated lists
        ```   
        This produces the following result:
        ```text
        ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003]
        abcd
        [786, 2.23]
        [2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003]
        [123, 'john', 123, 'john']
        ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003, 123, 'john']
        ```
    3. ### Python Tuples
        * A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list.
        * A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parenthesis.
        * The main difference between _lists_ and _tuples_ are - Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.
