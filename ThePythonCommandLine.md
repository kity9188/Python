# Python Quickstart
Python is an interpreted programming language, this means directly run code on command line. To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.

	* Type your code, say `print ("Hello There!")`.
	* Save it in a file with extension `.py`. E.g. `hello.py`
	
	* type python in the search bar (on a Windows PC).
	* `python <filename>.py` e.g., `python hello.py`. Output will be displayed on the command line only.
	
	or
	
	* From terminal/command line:
	* type `python` to enter into python environment.
	* This will also display  the version of python installed in the system.
	* For simply testing any code from command line, without saving, just type the command e.g. `>>> print ("Hello There!")` and press enter.
	* The output should read: `Hello There`
	* To exit: `Crtl + Z + Enter` key combination or just `exit()`.
