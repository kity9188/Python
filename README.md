# for Loop
A for loop actually takes a range of values and assigns them one by one to a variable.
Then it executes a block of code once for each value.

e.g.,
```python
for i in range (1,6):
	print("i is now {}".format(i))
```
Will give the output:
```python
i is now 1
i is now 2
i is now 3
i is now 4
i is now 5
