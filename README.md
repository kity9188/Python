# Indentation in Python

Unlike most programming languages Python works in blocks of code;
i.e., it doesn't uses brackets {} for blocks, instead uses indentation. 
Actually one of the design principals of Python was that it should be uncluttered and easy to read.
Because of this Python's doesn't use delimiters and blocks of code.
