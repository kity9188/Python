# Early computers could only perform addition. In order to multiply one number by another,
# they performed repeated addition.
#
# For example: 5*8 was performed by adding 5 eight times 5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5=40.
#
# Use a for loop and augmented assignment to give answer the result of multiplying number by multiplier.

number = 5
multiplier = 8
answer = 0

# add your loop after this comment
for multiply in range(multiplier):
	answer += number
print(answer)
