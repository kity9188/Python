# Python Syntax

1) ***Python Indentations***
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. e.g.,
~~~
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
~~~
  
Python will give error or may not give correct result, if we skip the indentation.

2) ***Comments***
Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment.
~~~
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, There!")
~~~

3) ***Docstrings***
Docstrings are used for documentation purpose. It can be one line, or multiline. Python uses triple quotes at the beginning and end of the docstring:
~~~
"""This is a 
multiline docstring."""
print("Hello, There!")
~~~
